## Code Projects of Note

### SCOTUS_Servo

[@SCOTUS_servo](https://twitter.com/scotus_servo) is a project to keep track of Supreme Court opinions and, specifically, to identify changes in them. Here is [a presentation about @SCOTUS_servo](https://esq.io/presentations/scotus-servo-presentation.html) and [here is the source code](https://github.com/vzvenyach/scotus-servo). It is built using Node.

### Legal Markdown

[LegalMarkdownJS](http://legalmarkdown.com) is an effort to build a browser-based editor for legal documents. It is built using Node, React, and Browserify. Here is [the source code](https://github.com/vzvenyach/legalmd).

### Effdate

[Effdate](http://effdate.esq.io) is a way of calculating the effective date of District of Columbia legislation. Under the peculiar counting rules of the Home Rule Act, it used to be essentially impossible to simply estimate when a bill would go into effect. Effdate solves that problem. Here is [the source code](https://github.com/vzvenyach/effdate).

### Due Processr

At the [ABA Journal's first Hackess to Justice Hackathon](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/hackcess_to_justice_teams_will_devise_new_tech_to_solve_access_to_justice_i/), I worked with [David Colarusso](http://davidcolarusso.com), a fellow lawyer-coder, and [William Li](http://people.csail.mit.edu/wli/), a MIT doctoral candidate, to build [Due Processr](http://dueprocessr.org). The app calculates whether an individual is considered indigent under Massachsetts law and also calculates the sentencing range given a criminal history and current charges. The app took [3rd place](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyers_and_developers_take_part_in_inaugural_hackcess_to_justice_legal_hac/) at the hackathon.
