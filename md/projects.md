Here is [a presentation about @SCOTUS_servo](https://esq.io/presentations/scotus-servo-presentation.html) and [here is the source code](https://github.com/vzvenyach/scotus-servo).

### Legal Markdown

[LegalMarkdownJS](http://legalmarkdown.com) is an effort to build a browser-based editor for legal documents. It is built using Node, React, and Browserify. Here is [the source code](https://github.com/vzvenyach/legalmd).

### Effdate

[Effdate](http://effdate.esq.io) is a way of calculating the effective date of District of Columbia legislation. Under the peculiar counting rules of the Home Rule Act, it used to be essentially impossible to simply estimate when a bill would go into effect. Effdate solves that problem. Here is [the source code](https://github.com/vzvenyach/effdate).
