title: 'Some New Data on Innovation and Research'
subtitle: A few takeaways from the NSF's biennial report
---

A few days ago, I wrote about [government and innovation policy](https://vdavez.com/2020/01/winners-or-losers/). Yesterday, the National Science Foundation published [The State of U.S. Science and Engineering 2020](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20201/preface). Although I am still digging into the report and the data, there are a few things that were interesting straightaway.

1. Spending on R&D internationally is [growing significantly](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20203/executive-summary). Specifically, spending has tripled internationally from $722 billion in 2000 to $2.153 trillion in 2017. This growth is largely due to China's growth and investment in R&D.
2. Americans' [perceptions of confidence in the scientific community](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20201/invention-innovation-and-perceptions-of-science#figureCtr892) is heavily dependent on educational attainment. Only 29% of Americans with less than a high-school diploma have a "great deal of confidence" in the scientific community. By contrast, 68% of Americans with a graduate degree or higher have a "great deal of confidence".
3. One of the most interesting trends is the [decline in new firms](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20204/innovation-indicators-united-states-and-other-major-economies#figureCtr942). In 1982, 50% of all American companies were less than 5 years old. In 2016, only 33% of all American companies are less than 5 years old.
4. International venture capital is [having hockey stick growth](http://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20204/innovation-indicators-united-states-and-other-major-economies#figureCtr944). Also interesting that _both_ US and China are increasing investments into "mobile" technologies from ~$9B in 2013 to $59B in 2018. Meanwhile, the US venture capital is heavily investing in AI ($16B), whereas China venture capital is investing in eCommerce ($21B).

It's also worth observing that, in this time of sometimes bitter disagreement about basic facts, we are lucky to have the National Science Foundation's report helping us get a better picture of the state of innovation today. I hope you enjoy reading it.
