Chances are, if you live in the United States, that the buildings on the side of the street where you are reading this are all even or all odd, and the buildings on the _opposite_ side of the street are the opposite.

But *why* is this the case? How did this come to pass?

As it turns out, you can trace this convention back to the [Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 (the "Enumeration Clause") of the US Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-2/clause-3/enumeration-clause), which established the United States Census, and to Philadelphia, which was the nation's capital during the first national census!

**That's right: modern cities use an odd/even house numbering convention, which draws its origin from the founding of the US constitution!**

While reading Dan Bouk's [Democracy's Data: The Hidden Stories in the U.S. Census and How to Read Them](https://bookshop.org/p/books/democracy-s-data-the-hidden-stories-in-the-u-s-census-and-how-to-read-them-dan-bouk/18721705), I came across this assertion and confirmed this citation. But then I went one step further to learn more. Here's the best source, [a doctoral thesis entitled "Governmentality, the Grid, and the Beginnings of a Critical Spatial History of the Geo-Coded World"](https://www.academia.edu/281406/Governmentality_the_Grid_and_the_Beginnings_of_a_Critical_Spatial_History_of_the_Geo_Coded_World):

> During the 1790s, the practice of placing odd and even numbers along
opposite sides of the street became common. The U.S. Marshal who conducted the
first federal census in Philadelphia (1790), Clement Biddle, renumbered the cityâ€™s houses and separated odd and even numbers on different sides of the street. Interestingly, Biddle (1791) then published his own city directory based upon this new numbering scheme.

The full thesis on "house numbering" is actually a super interesting read. He argues that "as a spatial practice, house numbering is a comparatively recent innovation, which did not become widespread until the second half of the eighteenth century, and in some cities the practice was not systematically adopted until well into the nineteenth century." 

So if numbering didn't start until the eighteenth century, why did house numbering start in the first place?

> The emergence of house numbering as a spatial practice cannot solely been attributed to a single factor. Rather, there were multiple forces at work. On the one hand, centralized military control is a key element in explaining the rise of house numbering in France (with the exception of Paris). Equally important was the use of house numbers for civil administration in urban centers. The practice of administratively affixing individuals to specific numerical addresses enabled the government to more easily tax its population, facilitated the conducting of a national census, and also served as the administrative basis for the commodification of space.
