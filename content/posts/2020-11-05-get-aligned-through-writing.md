  One of the best ways to get an organization, particularly a distributed organization, aligned on strategy and decisionmaking is to cultivate a writing culture in the organization.

One of the challenges delivery teams inevitably face is getting aligned on a product vision. If you've ever found yourself struggling to align your team, you've probably encountered frameworks involving various canvasses, or metrics (KPIs/OKRs), or maybe even dreamed of pulling together a team offsite to really get on the same page. But in a world where teams are increasingly distributed, and meetings are virtual, how can you get on the same page? And which framework should you choose?

The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, seems to be that there is no single solution. There is, however, a universal component of the answer, and that's to **improve your team's writing**.

Cultivating a writing culture in an organization may seem like a strange goal until you realize that good writing is already core to almost every part of a successful organization. Good documentation? Writing. Sales and marketing copy? Writing. Compelling user stories? Writing. In fact, I'm aware of no successful organization of any reasonable size that does not depend on effective use of the written word.

It turns out that writing can help you be more critical, more creative, and more attentive. What organization wouldn't benefit from more critical thinking, more creativity, and more attention? Although excellent writing isn't an easy skill to cultivate, it is one of the most important.

Teams that do not prioritize writing or emphasize the importance of written communication, I have found, struggle to make good strategic decisions over the long term. Gaining alignment is fundamentally about developing a shared understanding of the situation, of the opportunity, and of the approach. Developing an organizational writing practice can quickly improve the speed with which you can develop that shared understanding.

You may object that writing will take time away from "shipping." And like so much in product and delivery, there are tradeoffs. If you don't spend time writing early, eventually you'll suffer from a "communication debt." Spend too much time writing and you'll never get to launch. Balance is important.

But, ultimately, if your team is struggling to get aligned, it may be a good signal that you need to slow down and, as a team, start writing down your thoughts and ideas. You might be surprised at how much faster you can move forward collectively, once you've starting reducing your collective ideas to writing.

If you lead a team, or are part of team, that is thinking about investing in gaining strategic alignment, before you reach for Measure What Matters or a silver-bullet Medium post about strategic planning, consider sharing this blog post and encouraging your peers to stop, think for 15 minutes, write 1000 words on "what's working, what's not working, what needs to change, and what is our big opportunity," and share your learnings.

Have you worked in an organization with a strong writing culture? I'd love to know how you contributed to it!
