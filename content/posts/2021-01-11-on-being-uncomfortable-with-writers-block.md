Today, I have writer's block. And so, I am just writing.

According to [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2020/06/the-simple-cure-for-writers-block/), the act of writing is the cure to writer's block. As he puts it:

> The best way to address this isn't to wait to be perfect. Because if you wait, you'll never get there.
> The best way to deal with it is to write, and to realize that your bad writing isnâ€™t fatal.

We like to imagine that good writing is that is the result of inspiration and natural talent. Godin's advice suggests that good writing is the result of _practice_.

It's helpful to think about writing as the cure for writer's block as we think about other "blockers" in our life. How many mental blocks are the result of fear of perfection? How many times do we decline to take action because we aren't confident in our own voice or abilities?

In that way, the advice to _lean in_ to those fears and recognize that blockers are a sign that you simply need practice. You _can_, but only if you _do_.
