At long last, the [Code of the District of Columbia](https://beta.code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/) has a permanent URL, within the [dccouncil.us](http://dccouncil.us) domain. This may not seem like a big deal, but this simple event is the culmination of years of effort, and I couldn't possibly be happier.

<!--break-->

Much has [already](http://www.govexec.com/state-local/2014/07/ultimate-open-government-unlocking-laws/87997/) [been](https://opengovdata.io/2014/state-laws-the-district-columbia-code/) [written](http://www.macwright.org/2013/04/04/the-open-code.html) about the work to first get the code up online. To get from an unofficial DC Code to today, though, was the result of many many folks, too numerous to name really. But here are twelve:

- [Tom MacWright](http://www.macwright.org/), the developer who started this whole thing
- Ben Bryant, the Codification Counsel for the Council of the District of Columbia
- [Josh Tauberer](https://razor.occams.info/), the civic hacker who worked with me many times to move the ball forward
- David Greisen, the Council's Free Law Innovation Fellow, who took the ball and carried it to the endzone
- Ellen Efros, the current General Counsel to the Council of the District of Columbia
- [Carl Malamud](https://public.resource.org/), the Rogue Archivist who pushed all of us
- [Seamus Kraft](opengovfoundation.org/), the Co-Founder of the OpenGov Foundation and who spurred the free-law innovation movement into action
- [Ed Walters](https://twitter.com/EJWalters), the CEO of Fastcase who has been fighting in the trenches for the free law movement
- [Waldo Jaquith](https://waldo.jaquith.org/), the delightful and unstoppable force for good for all things open data who created the States Decoded
- [Eric Mill](https://konklone.com), the developer and friend who persuaded me to write my first scraper
- [Chairman Phil Mendelson](http://chairmanmendelson.com/), the Council Chairman (and his staff) who supported this effort from day one
- Chris Warren, the Council's Chief Technology Officer

The craziest part is that there are literally dozens more I could name. Ok, here are a few more:

- the DC Legal Hacker and Code for DC communities
- the Arnold Foundation
- Nyasha Smith and Jen Budoff
- the Uniform Law Commission (particularly Michele Timmons)
- and so many more

And in that sense, what makes me happiest of all is not the code, though that's certainly nice. What makes me happiest of all is that, in making this small thing a reality, I've had the incredible luck to work alongside and become friends with so many brilliant people.
