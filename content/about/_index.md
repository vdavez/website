## What I'm Working On

Dave is a founder and principal at [TandemGov](https://tandemgov.com/), a consultancy that supports organizations navigate government procurement through the full procurement lifecycle, including product development, go-to-market strategy, pricing, proposal development, compliance, and more.

## Government Leadership

Most recently, Dave served as Director of the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) at the U.S. General Services Administration, where he oversaw nearly 40 programs, including FedRAMP, Presidential Innovation Fellows, Login.gov, US Web Design System, and 18F.

For his work at TTS, Dave was credited as a "visionary and champion of building sustainable and equitable civic tech partnerships, scaling governmentwide shared services, and improving the way the American public engages with government."

Dave's government service also includes roles as Senior Technical Advisor and Assistant Commissioner for GSA's Federal Acquisition Service Office of Systems Management; Executive Director of 18F; Deputy Commissioner for TTS; Assistant Commissioner for the TTS Office of Acquisition; General Counsel to the DC Council; Chief of Staff to Councilmember Mary Cheh; and judicial law clerk to United States District Judge Yvette Kane.
