I help organizations navigate the intersection of law, technology, and public policy to build better systems that serve people.

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm focused on several exciting projects: consulting with organizations on technology strategy and go-to-market approaches, writing about government innovation at [GovContrActually](https://govcontractually.com/), and founding a tech startup. I also chair a special committee for the Uniform Law Commission focused on automated technology liabilityâ€”exploring how our legal frameworks need to evolve for emerging technologies.

## Background

My career has been shaped by a unique perspective gained from working across all three branches of government at federal, state, and local levels. Most recently, I served as Director of the Technology Transformation Services at the U.S. General Services Administration, where I led efforts to modernize how government delivers digital services.

Before that, I held leadership roles at 18F (as Executive Director), worked in federal procurement modernization, served as General Counsel to the DC Council, and clerked for a federal judge. Between government roles, I've also worked as an independent consultant and Director of Product at Hangar.

## Expertise

I specialize in the messy, fascinating problems that emerge when law meets technology:

- **Government Technology**: Digital transformation, procurement reform, and policy implementation
- **Legal Innovation**: How technology changes legal practice and regulatory frameworks  
- **Public-Private Collaboration**: Building bridges between sectors for better outcomes
- **Strategic Communication**: Writing and speaking about complex policy and technology issues

## Recognition & Service

I've been recognized as a Legal Rebel, Fed 100 honoree, and Open Data Pioneer. The DC Council recognized me as a "role model for public service," and I received the DC Bar's Exceptional Service Award for establishing their first government pro bono program. I'm an ABA Fellow and serve on Wisconsin's delegation to the Uniform Law Commission.

## Writing & Teaching

I've written extensively about the intersection of law and technology, including the book *Coding for Lawyers*. I've also taught at George Washington University Law School and developed training programs for government technology professionals.

## Education & Personal

I earned my J.D. from George Washington University Law School and a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin. I live with my family in Oregon, Wisconsin, where we enjoy small-town life and the kids keep us busy with sports and adventures.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in conversations about technology, law, and building better systems. Email me at dave@zvenyach.com or [schedule time to chat](https://fantastical.app/vdavez/virtual-coffee).
