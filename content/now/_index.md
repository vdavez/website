Living in Oregon, WI, enjoying the remaining weeks of fall. Spouse is consulting and teaching. Kids are 11 and 9 and busy with swimming, basketball, video games, causing trouble, etc.

I am recovering from my most recent tour in federal service and doing very little formally productive work. But I am still keeping relatively busy:

- Getting on that Peloton
- Chairing a special committee of the Uniform Law Commission related to automated technology liability
- Some longform writing on topics of personal interest
- Trying out this NaNoWriMo thing
- Dabbling in learning about number theory
- Playing around with Raspberry Pi Picos and my new 3D printer
