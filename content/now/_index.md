title: Now
---

Living in Fitchburg, WI, though still back to DC on a pretty regular basis. Spouse is still making the world healthier, focused on obesity policy. Kids are 8 and 6 and busy with karate, basketball, and Minecraft. I'm at [Hangar](https://hangar.is), building new companies, and trying to learn as much as I can about all things software and data. I have a lot of other things on the plate, primarily Uniform Law Commission committees and training related to digital government, though I'm trying to embrace the "Hell Yes or No" philosophy.

Beyond that, been trying to maintain my physical health through regular exercise (yay [OTF!](https://www.orangetheoryfitness.com/)), diet, and sleep; my mental health through meditation and avoiding social media; and my energy through reading and rediscovering jazz.
