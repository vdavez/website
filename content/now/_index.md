Living in Oregon, WI, enjoying the start of summer. Spouse is elevating and empowering those affected by obesity through education, advocacy and support. Kids are 11 and 9 and busy with swimming, basketball, softball, causing trouble, etc.

I've been keeping my head down a lot this year. Here's what I'm working on:

- Chairing a special committee of the Uniform Law Commission related to automated technology liability
- Writing at [GovContrActually](https://govcontractually.com/)
- Doing some consulting work, largely focused on tech and GTM strategy.
- Founding a tech startup! (More on that later...)
