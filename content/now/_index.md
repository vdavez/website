Living in Oregon, WI, although I'm moving into Madison later this summer. Spouse is still elevating and empowering those affected by obesity through education, advocacy and support. Kids are 13 and 12 and busy with swimming, basketball, softball, causing trouble, etc.

Keeping busy with TandemGov, MakeGov, and a bunch of other smaller activities.
