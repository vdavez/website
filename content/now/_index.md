Living in Fitchburg, WI, enjoying the last weeks of fall before winter is upon us. Spouse is working hard to [keep the most vulnerable among us safe from COVID-19](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/health-med-fit/madison-nurses-start-company-to-provide-online-covid-19-screening/article_26d6c436-f343-5016-ae35-5af1699b9731.html). Kids are 9 and 7 and working hard on their tree fort. I'm at [Hangar](https://hangar.is), building new companies, and trying to learn as much as I can about all things software and data. Still trying to embrace the "Hell Yes or No" philosophy.
