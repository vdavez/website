Living in Oregon, WI, trying to survive the first month of winter. Spouse is consulting and teaching. Kids are 11 and 9 and busy with swimming, basketball, orchestra, band, video games, causing trouble, etc.

I am still recovering from my most recent tour in federal service and doing very little formally productive work. But I am still keeping relatively busy:

- Getting on that Peloton
- Chairing a special committee of the Uniform Law Commission related to automated technology liability
- Reading a *lot*
- Learning to cook Indian food and perfecting my Masala Chai recipe
- Blogging and writing
