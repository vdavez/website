The intersection of intellectual-property laws and government works is an interesting topic. But last night I happened across a delightfully random law entitled _An Act To prevent the unauthorized manufacture and use of the character 'Woodsy Owl', and for other purposes_, [Pub. L. No. 93-317, 88 Stat. 244](https://uscode.house.gov/statutes/pl/93/318.pdf).

In the act, Congress made "Woodsy Owl" part of the "National Symbols Cache," and declared their name and likeness the property of the United States. The [definition of Woodsy Owl](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title16-section580p&num=0&edition=prelim), though, is a... hoot!

> (1) the term "Woodsy Owl" means the name and representation of a fanciful owl, who wears slacks (forest green when colored), a belt (brown when colored), and a Robin Hood style hat (forest green when colored) with a feather (red when colored), and who furthers the slogan, "Give a Hoot, Don't Pollute", originated by the Forest Service of the United States Department of Agriculture;

A fanciful owl, indeed!

A careful reader might observe that the act also references Smokey Bear in decidedly less colorful terms. That's because Smokey Bear was protected by a more staid Congress in 1952 when it passed _An Act Prohibiting the manufacture or use of the character 'Smokey Bear' by unauthorized persons_, [Pub. L. No. 93-318, 66 Stat. 92](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-66/pdf/STATUTE-66-Pg91-2.pdf#page=2).

That said, looks like Smokey Bear ended up winning the popularity contest:
