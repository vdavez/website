While playing around with yet another random data set, I came across the Acer Access and Development Program. Here's the description on the [website](https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/acer): 

> The Acer Access and Development Program (Acer) offers grants to support the efforts of States, tribal governments, and research institutions to promote the domestic maple syrup industry. Supported activities include: promotion of research and education related to maple syrup production; promotion of natural resource sustainability in the maple syrup industry; market promotion for maple syrup and maple-sap products; encouragement of owners and operators of privately held land containing species of trees in the genus Acer to initiate or expand maple-sugaring activities on the land; or to voluntarily make the land available, including by lease or other means, for access by the public for maple-sugaring activities.

So, today, I really learned a few things: 

1. This program exists; and 
2. The genus for maple trees is "Acer"
3. In Fiscal Year 2021, the Acer Program made grant $5,428,208.66 in [grant awards](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/AcerFY21DescriptionofFundedProjects.pdf).
4. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup), Quebec accounts for 70% of the world's maple syrup production.
5. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, the [United States produced](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/tm70mv177/w3764d11b/6q183r18c/crop0522.pdf) 3.424 million gallons of syrup, which means there was almost 140 million gallons of sap collected! That's a lot of syrup!
6. According to [one report](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/maple-syrup-market-report), the global maple syrup market size was valued at $1.49 billion in 2021!
