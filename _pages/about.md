## About Dave

<img src="/assets/images/Zvenyach.jpg" class=".visible-sm img-circle pull-right" width="200" style="padding:10px" />
I live in the District of Columbia with my incredibly talented spouse and two young children.

For my day job, I am the Director of Acquisition Management for [18F Consulting](https://18f.gsa.gov/consulting/). Previously, I was the General Counsel to the [Council of the District of Columbia](http://dccouncil.us). This website is not, however, an official site and nothing in the site should be construed as either (1) legal advice or solicitation, or (2) an endorsement by the United States Government, or before that, the Council of any of the views, data, or information shared on this site.

If you're into it, you can read about [what I'm working on right now](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/28/announcing-the-agile-BPA-awards/) and [some of the things I worked on while at the Council](http://www.govexec.com/state-local/2014/07/ultimate-open-government-unlocking-laws/87997/). Until joining 18F, most of what I did was traditional legal work. Now at 18F, most of what I do oscillates between federal procurement and software development.

In 2014, I was honored to receive the D.C. Bar's [Exceptional Service Award](http://www.dcbar.org/about-the-bar/news/award-winners.cfm) for the establishment of the [Council's Pro Bono Program](http://dcclims1.dccouncil.us/images/00001/20130611180045.pdf). I am also active with the [D.C. Bar](http://dcbar.org) and with the [Uniform Law Commission](http://uniformlaws.org), and am a member of the [Washington Council of Lawyers](http://wclawyers.org). Finally, I am a member of the Board of Directors of the DC Open Government Coalition.

On the side, I am an ["accomplished armchair coder"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/mike-debonis/wp/2014/03/19/dcdecoded-org-offers-better-public-access-to-d-c-laws/) and have written at least one ["clever piece of code."](http://gigaom.com/2014/06/12/clever-piece-of-code-exposes-hidden-changes-to-supreme-court-opinions/) For details about my projects, see my [Projects Page](projects.html). I recently was named a [FastCase 50 winner](http://www.fastcase.com/fastcase50-winners-2014/) for some of these projects. Recently, I was named a [Legal Rebel](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/meet_our_2015_legal_rebels/) by the ABA Journal.
