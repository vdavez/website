## About Dave

<img src="/assets/images/Zvenyach.jpg" class=".visible-sm img-circle pull-right" width="200" style="padding:10px" />
I live in the District of Columbia with my incredibly talented spouse and two young children.

For my day job, I am the Acting Deputy Commissioner for the General Services Administration Technology Transformation Service (TTS), Acting Executive Director of [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov), and the permanent Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Acquisition for TTS. Previously, I was the General Counsel to the [Council of the District of Columbia](http://dccouncil.us).
