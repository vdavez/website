## About Dave

<img src="/assets/images/Zvenyach.jpg" class=".visible-sm img-circle pull-right" width="200" style="padding:10px" />
I live just outside of Madison, WI, with my incredibly talented spouse and two young children.

I'm a leader in government and digital services, and an expert in open government data and acquisition innovation. I'm also a member of the Wisconsin delegation to the Uniform Law Commission and wrote Coding for Lawyers. I've been named a [Legal Rebel](http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/v_david_zvenyach_profile/), a [Legal Hacker of the Year](http://dclegalhackers.org/blog/2015/01/06/the2014lehackiewinners.html), a [Fed 100](https://fcw.com/articles/2017/03/30/fed100-zvenyach-david.aspx), and an [Open Data Pioneer](https://usopendata.org/2014/12/17/zvenyach/).

For my day job, I am a Senior Technical Advisor at the US General Services Administration. I've held a number of leadership roles at GSA, including the Acting Assistant Commissioner for the Federal Acquisition Service Office of Systems Management, the [Executive Director of 18F](https://18f.gsa.gov), and Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Acquisition for the General Services Administration's Technology Transformation Services.

Before joining GSA, I was the General Counsel to the [Council of the District of Columbia](http://dccouncil.us). There, I helped DC achieve budget autonomy, created the District's first government pro bono program, and rewrote the District's legislative drafting manual. Before that, I was Chief of Staff to DC Councilmember Mary Cheh and a law clerk for United States District Judge Yvette Kane.

I'm a graduate of GW Law School (JD) and the University of Wisconsin (BS, Mechanical Engineering).
