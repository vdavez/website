## Code Projects of Note

### Coding for Lawyers

[Coding for Lawyers](http://codingforlawyers.com) is an effort to teach the basics of web development to lawyers. Some may question whether the world needs more lawyers, but it is indisputable that the world needs more legal hackers!

### SCOTUS_Servo

[@SCOTUS_servo](https://twitter.com/scotus_servo) is a project to keep track of Supreme Court opinions and, specifically, to identify changes in them. Here is [a presentation about @SCOTUS_servo](https://esq.io/presentations/scotus-servo-presentation.html) and [here is the source code](https://github.com/vzvenyach/scotus-servo). It is built using Node.

### HTMLDecks

[HTMLDecks](https://htmldecks.com) lets users create simple presentations using free and open-source software, hosted for free on the web. It is built using Node and ExpressJS, and uses MongoDB as the database. Here is the [source code](https://github.com/vzvenyach/htmldecks). 

### Legal Markdown

[LegalMarkdownJS](http://legalmarkdown.com) is an effort to build a browser-based editor for legal documents. It is built using Node, React, and Browserify. Here is [the source code](https://github.com/vzvenyach/legalmd).

### Permafrast

[Permafrast](https://permafrast.herokuapp.com) is a little application that let's you link to a judicial opinion using Fastcase's public API using the case citation. If, for example, you wanted to go directly to the _Citizen's United_ decision, you could simply point your browser at <https://permafrast.herokuapp.com/558/U.S./310/redirect>. Simple as that.

### Effdate

[Effdate](http://effdate.esq.io) is a way of calculating the effective date of District of Columbia legislation. Under the peculiar counting rules of the Home Rule Act, it used to be essentially impossible to simply estimate when a bill would go into effect. Effdate solves that problem. Here is [the source code](https://github.com/vzvenyach/effdate).

### Due Processr

At the [ABA Journal's first Hackess to Justice Hackathon](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/hackcess_to_justice_teams_will_devise_new_tech_to_solve_access_to_justice_i/), I worked with [David Colarusso](http://davidcolarusso.com), a fellow lawyer-coder, and [William Li](http://people.csail.mit.edu/wli/), a MIT doctoral candidate, to build [Due Processr](http://dueprocessr.org). The app calculates whether an individual is considered indigent under Massachsetts law and also calculates the sentencing range given a criminal history and current charges. The app took [3rd place](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyers_and_developers_take_part_in_inaugural_hackcess_to_justice_legal_hac/) at the hackathon.
