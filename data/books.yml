    It's been a long time since I read a science-fiction/fantasy trilogy, and I'm kicking myself for not learning about N.K. Jemisin years ago. Better late than never, though, and the Inheritance Trilogy is just excellent. By the end of the third book, I found myself marveling at the unique personalities, politics, science, and social structures on display throughout the trilogy. Each character flawed, each character beautiful, each doomed and destined according to their nature. I already look forward to reading my next Jemisin trilogy.

    When it comes to maximizing innovation, what's the right role for government? Conventional wisdom is that government should avoid "picking winners and losers" and instead stick to addressing market failures and helping the innocent victims of Schumpeterian creative destruction. Mazzucato takes the conventional wisdom head on, and persuasively argues that the most innovative companies in the world owe their origins to state-sponsored industrial policies and research & development. For example, Mazzucato documents how "nearly every state-of-the-art technology found in the iPod, iPhone, and iPad is an often overlooked and ignored achievement of the research efforts and funding support of the government and military." She also takes on macroeconomic trends associated with private-research expenditures, and argues that publicly held corporations increasingly have relied on publicly funded research while seeking tax breaks and engaging in share buybacks. The book is provocative and challenging (she forced me to reconsider a few of my own assumptions and beliefs), although faily repetitive and sometimes dense reading. I'd recommend the first and last three chapters if remotely interested in innovation or growth policy.

- title: This is Marketing

    For more than 20 years, Seth Godin has written about and championed the idea of "permission marketing," which turns on the insight that in our modern economy, peoples' attention is a scarce resource, and therefore that *earning* attention is essential to business success. His books are a model for this type of marketing. He consistently offers useful insights, practical suggestions, and encouragement on how to approach marketing in today's market. In *This is Marketing*, Godin delivers another excellent contribution to his collection. He introduces concepts such as the "minimal viable audience," helps us understand the central significance of "status" in change, and teaches about how creating and relieving "tension" is core to successful marketing. He argues that marketing is change, and that successful marketing is essentially leading culture change for the community we wish to serve. In the end, Godin demonstrates firsthand how successful marketing isn't a crass act of commercialism; instead, it is a generous act of service.
- title: The Dragon Republic
  author: R.F. Kuang
  rating: 3.5

    Coming off the heels of the *Poppy War*, I had high expectations for the *Dragon Republic*. The good news is that Kuang is setting up for an incredible finale in the next book. In the Dragon Republic, Kuang allows us to go deeper into the minds and hearts of the lead characters of the book. Fang Runin is no longer simply a military version of rags-to-riches, she is a character that struggles, matures, and rages in fascinating ways. The bad news, though, is the book often felt like a military campaign, a routine slog punctuated by action and emotion. Characters with promise come and went; and yet, there are narrative retreats that hold promise for book three. By the end of the Dragon Republic, I was glad to have made it, because I am eager to read the last in the trilogy when it comes.
